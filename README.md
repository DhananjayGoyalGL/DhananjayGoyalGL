I have been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built my first React project.
The library makes me want to learn JavaScript more. I'm currently on the lookout for a role in frontend web development, ideally writing React or JavaScript. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit where I can make an impact. If you are hiring, [let's chat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhananjaygoyal/).
